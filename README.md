# BigQuery YAML Generator 

This project allows your to quickly generate YAML files for each table in your BigQuery Warehouse. The YAML files include the table schema's pulled from the BigQuery API, and a table and column description, which is generated by GPT.

Credits to GPT for generating the README.

## Getting Started 

To get started, you will need to install `requirements.txt` which includes the necessary pip packages for the script, as well as create a virtualenv with Python.

### Installation
Follow these instructions to get the BigQuery YAML Generator running on your system:

1. Install the pip packages from `requirements.txt`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create the virtual environment, with a Python version >3.6

```
virtualenv -p python3 env
```

3. Activate the virtual environment

```
source env/bin/activate
```

4. Retrieve your BigQuery credentials, by creating a service account for your warehouse project.


## Generating YAML files 

Once you have your BigQuery credentials, you can generate the YAML files by running the following in the command line:

```
python3 table_yaml_generator.py --bigquery_credentials_filepath /Users/rahul/Desktop/wh_service_accounts/lifeline-oauth-2-31ec407e8880.json --output_dir yaml_output
```

The program will prompt you to enter the BigQuery dataset or table name, which is the source for generating the YAML files.
